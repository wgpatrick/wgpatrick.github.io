## Biography

Will Patrick is an entrepreneur and technologist with expertise spanning biotechnology, robotics, and digital fabrication. He is the founder of Culture Biosciences, where he served as CEO for 8 years (2016-2024), developing cloud-based bioprocess development platforms for the biotechnology industry. Previously, at Google[x], he worked as a Rapid Evaluator helping initiate Project Wing, Google's drone delivery effort. Will holds an M.S. from MIT Media Lab, where he researched 3D printed microfluidics and synthetic biology in the Mediated Matter group, resulting in multiple peer-reviewed publications and exhibitions at institutions including the Cooper Hewitt Smithsonian Design Museum. His work has led to over 20 patents in areas ranging from UAV systems to bioprocess control. Will received his B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from Duke University.
